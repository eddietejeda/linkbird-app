LinkBird is a newsfeed based on your Twitter account. Stay up to date without scrolling through <i>a lot</i> of chatter. 

##### How does LinkBird work?

LinkBird connects to your account and looks for links shared by the people that you follow.

When you first create an account, you will only see a couple links, but after a couple of minutes, LinkBird will stay in sync with Twitter. If you're on a mobile device, you also can refresh your links by pulling down on the LinkBird timeline.

Over time, we'll be adding features that will make it easy for you to slice and dice your links in creative ways. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please contact suggestions@linkbird.app.

##### What are the terms of service and privacy policy?

Privacy is at the center of LinkBird and its solely funded by you - its subscribers. Please review the [Terms of Service](/terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy) for more information.
