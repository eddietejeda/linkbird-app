### What is LinkBird?

LinkBird connects to your Twitter account and retrieves the most interesting links from your timeline, making it easy for you to stay on top of the latest news without the chatter.


##### How does LinkBird work?
The links in LinkBird come directly from your Twitter timeline.  When you first create an account, LinkBird presents you with only your most recent links. Since your Twitter timeline is continuously changing, LinkBird works behind the scenes to make sure the links you see are always fresh.  

If you're on a mobile device, you also can download the most recent links by pulling down on your timeline.

Over time, we'll be adding features that will make it easy for you to slice and dice your newsfeed in new and interesting ways. If you have any suggestions, please contact suggestions@linkbird.app.
