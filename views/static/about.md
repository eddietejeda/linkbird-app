### How does LinkBird work?

LinkBird is a service that eliminates the noise from your newsfeed. LinkBird connects to your Twitter account and retrieves the most interesting links from your timeline, making it easy for you to stay on top of the latest news.

The links in LinkBird come directly from your timeline and are not chronological.  When you first create an account, LinkBird does not go back to your timeline history. It only looks forward, which means that LinkBird improves the most you use it.

Since your Twitter home timeline is continuously changing, LinkBird also refreshes the data in the background. That means that every time to check out LinkBird, you'll see the freshest content.  If you're on a mobile device, you also can download the most recent links by pulling down on your timeline.

Over time, we'll be adding features that will make it easier for you to slice and dice your feed in new and interesting ways. If you have any suggestions, please contact suggestions@linkbird.app.
