### What is LinkBird?

<img src="/images/phone-view.png" style="top: 0; float: right; width: 200px; padding: 5px ; margin: 20px 50px 50px">

LinkBird connects to your Twitter account and retrieves the most interesting links from your timeline, allowing to stay on top of the latest news without the chatter.


##### How does LinkBird work?

The links in LinkBird come directly from your Twitter timeline.  When you first create an account, LinkBird only shows you your most recent links. Since your Twitter timeline is continuously changing, LinkBird works behind the scenes to make sure the links you see are always current.  If you're on a mobile device, you also can see new links by pulling down on your timeline.


Over time, we'll be adding features that will make it easy for you to slice and dice your newsfeed in interesting ways. If you have any suggestions, please contact suggestions@linkbird.app.
