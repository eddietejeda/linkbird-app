### What is LinkBird?

LinkBird was created to solve a simple challenge: finding interesting articles shared on Twitter without scrolling through <i>a lot</i> of chatter. Sometimes it's fun to follow Twitter discussions. Other times, it's not. 

##### How does LinkBird work?

LinkBird connects to your account and looks for links shared by the people that you follow. LinkBird then shows a preview of the article in a minimalist layout.  

When you first create an account, you will only see a couple links, but after a couple of minutes, LinkBird and Twitter will stay in sync.  If you're on a mobile device, you also can refresh your links by pulling down on the LinkBird timeline.

Over time, we'll be adding features that will make it easy for you to slice and dice your links in creative ways.  If you have any feedback or suggestions, please contact suggestions@linkbird.app.
