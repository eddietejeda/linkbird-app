### How does LinkBird work?

LinkBird connects to your Twitter account and retrieves interesting links from your timeline, making it easy for you to stay on top of the latest news while eliminating the noise.

The links in LinkBird come directly from your Twitter home timeline and are not chronological.  When you first create an account, LinkBird does not go back to your timeline. It only looks forward, meaning that LinkBird offers more relevant links the most you use it.

Since your Twitter home timeline is continuously changing, LinkBird also refreshes the data in the background. That means that every time to check out LinkBird, you'll see the freshest content.  If you're on a mobile device, you can download the most recent links by pulling down on your timeline.

Over time, we'll be adding features that will make it easier for you to slice and dice your feed in new and exciting ways. If you have any suggestions, please contact suggestions@linkbird.app.
