### Privacy 

#####  What information is collected?

LinkBird purposely uses the Twitter API calls with the least permissions. The only information collected from users are: 

* Twitter IDs and authentication keys 
* Tweets contents to display on LinkBird 


##### Use of cookies, log files, and tracking

* LinkBird's subscription fees ensure that the app is sustainable without ads.
* Cookies are primarily used for session management. 
* Basic fuzzy fingerprinting is used to help you manage and protect your active sessions in the [security page](/security) and not associated with any other data.  
* Server logs are used only for performance and technical diagnostics using New Relic.
* After 1000 links, a daily script automatically deletes old tweets.
