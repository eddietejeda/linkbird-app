### Privacy 

#####  What information is collected?

We purposely use the Twitter API calls with minimal access. The only information collected from users are: 

* Twitter IDs and authentication keys 
* Tweets contents to display on LinkBird 



##### Use of cookies, log files, and tracking

* LinkBird's subscription fees ensure that the app is sustainable without ads. 
* The site purposefully avoids using any form of tracking cookies, even avoiding tools like Google Analytics.
* Cookies are primarily used for session management. 
* Basic fingerprinting is used to help you manage and protect your active sessions in the [security page](/security) and not associated with any other data.  
* Server logs are used only for performance and technical diagnostics using New Relic.
